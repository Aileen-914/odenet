Open German WordNet

The Open-de-WordNet initiative is based on the idea to have a German resource in a multilingual WordNet initiative, where the concepts (the synsets) of the languages are linked, and where the resources are under an open-source license, being eventually included in the NLTK language processing package. WordNet resources are largely used in NLP projects all over the world. Our idea is to create a German resource that starts from a crowd-developed thesaurus, is going to be open, and included in the NLTK package, such that it will be further developed by researchers while using the resource for their NLP projects.
For the first version, we combined two existing resources: The OpenThesaurus German synonym lexicon (https://www.openthesaurus.de/) and the Open Multilingual WordNet English (http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/) resource, the PrincetonWordNet of English (PWN). The OpenThesaurus is a great chance of using a large resource, generated and updated by the crowd. The PWN resource is a well-developed resource for English concepts. It includes many relations between the concepts and is linked to resources for multiple languages. The current version is fully automatically compiled; it has not been manually checked.
